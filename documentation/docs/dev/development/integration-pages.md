# Integration pages

Integration pages are examples of how your application/website can interact with the Q-Consultation application.
Now the integration pages use links that lead to the provider's profile.

Link: `https://localhost:3001/providers/[provider_id]`

In this link, you need to replaceÂ `[provider_id]` with the id of the previously created provider.

To run the integration pages locally, you need to run the command: `npm run pages`.

This command will run integration pages on <http://localhost:8000> .

:::tip
Currently, there are available two integration examples. The source code can be found in the 'packages' folder >> 'integration-pages' (/packages/integration-pages).
