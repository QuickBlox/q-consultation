To make online appointments and video records work in the Q-Consultation app, itâ€™s necessary to import an appointment schema file to the QuickBlox admin panel.

:::caution
If you have registered your QuickBlox account via Google or GitHub and you do not have a password,
you can recover it on the [Forgot password](https://admin.quickblox.com/forgot) page or use another method to upload schema into application.
:::

You can add the schema automatically by running this command and following the instructions in the terminal.

<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
